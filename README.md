# HARD HAT Detector
The aim of this project is to detect if the personal in the image/video stream is wearning a HARD-HELMET using YOLO V5 Model.
## Introduction
This work tries to automate the monitoring of whether people are wearing hardhat on the construction sites. It ustilizes a Yolo v5 framework and it is trained on the HARD-HAT public dataset with more than 69 % mAP.
## Work Flow
The work flow is as follows

# Model Architecture 
YOLO V5 is based upon pytorch framework and is much faster and accuracte than its predeccesors.
The different models in YOLO V5 are described below -

#  Features

  - Highly accurate
  - better fps
  - Easy to train

# Usage
To use the model to recreate the results you can simply clone the repository and use the best.pt weights file in the model_weight folder . Rest just follow the collab notebook hard-hat implementations for implementation.

# Results
